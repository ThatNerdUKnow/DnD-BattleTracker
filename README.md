# dnd-battletracker
yeah, it's a work in progress.

## TODO
- Figure out how to display all the monster's stats and stuff ~ Partially done
- Make the HP stat interactive ✅
- Make a sidebar sort of thingy that lets you add and remove monsters from the battle ✅
- Track initative for monsters and PC's (this will probably require making a new vue component)
- Allow DM to add PC's (we don't need to track their stats, just keep their place in line, that's what DnDBeyond is for)
- Some entries in the bestiary don't like to play nice so edge cases in the API need to be worked out

- Make the whole app visually appealing but y'know, make it work THEN make it pretty
